![MainScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mr-davtyan/dnModeling/master/resources/dn_modeling_main_screen.PNG)

## Features
- Calculate Reflection, Phase and Group Delay of Fiber and Volume Bragg Gratings
- Windows executable file included
- Utilizes multiprocessing to speed up the calculation

## Notice
- The calculation takes a lot of computer resources.
- Adjust the number of CPUs in main window before the calculation if the app is not working stable.
- The number of CPUs is also affects the utilized RAM.
